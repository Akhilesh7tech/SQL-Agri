🌱 Agriculture Insights with SQL + Power BI
📖 Project Overview

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet it often suffers from unpredictable factors like rainfall, soil quality, and resource availability.
This project demonstrates how SQL (for data management) and Power BI (for visualization) can transform raw farming data into actionable insights.

🎯 Objectives

Store and process crop, rainfall, and region-wise farming data using SQL

Build interactive Power BI dashboards for agricultural insights

Identify correlations between crop yield, rainfall, and region efficiency

Provide data-driven recommendations for farmers, policymakers, and businesses

📂 Dataset (Sample)

The dataset includes:

Crop Data → Crop type, yield, planting & harvesting period

Rainfall Data → Monthly/seasonal rainfall by region

Regional Data → Region name, soil type, irrigation support

Market Data (planned) → Prices, demand trends (to be added in next phase)

(Note: All datasets are synthetic and created for demonstration purposes only.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

SQL → Data storage, cleaning, and analysis

Power BI → Interactive dashboard & visual storytelling

Excel/CSV → Input datasets

📊 Key Visualizations

Crop Yield vs Rainfall → Scatter plot showing correlation

Regional Performance → Bar chart ranking most productive regions

Top Crops by Yield → Tree map for high-performing crops

Trend Over Time → Line chart of yield & rainfall across seasons

(See /visuals folder for sample charts)

🚀 How to Run

Import datasets into your SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server).

Run the provided SQL scripts in /sql_scripts to create tables & queries.

Open the Power BI report (AgriInsights.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.

Connect the Power BI report to your SQL database or CSV exports.

🔮 Next Steps

Add soil quality data for deeper insights

Integrate market pricing & demand forecasting

Build a predictive model for crop yield forecasting

📌 Applications

👩‍🌾 Farmers → Optimize crop choices & irrigation usage

🏛️ Policymakers → Plan subsidies & infrastructure support

🏢 Businesses → Predict supply chain requirements
